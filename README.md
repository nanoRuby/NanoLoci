# nanoLoci vs 1.0

## Overview

This repository contains the software package nanoLoci, developed in conjunction with the paper titled [Image analysis optimisation for nanowire-based optical detection of molecules]. nanoLoci is designed for single-emitter localization, leveraging image fusion techniques for signal pre- and post-processing. 
It is specifically tailored for use with naowire-enhanced fluorescence or other nanostructures.

## Installation

To install nanoLoci, simply run the executable file named "runNanoLoci.m" within MATLAB. This will open the application as a MATLAB app.

### Dependencies

nanoLoci relies on the following MATLAB toolboxes:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

Please ensure that these toolboxes are installed in your MATLAB environment before running nanoLoci.

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to load your image data and perform single emitter localization using the provided tools and algorithms.
The manual for the usage ([NanoLoci_manual_30_04_24.pdf](https://github.com/nanoRuby/NanoLoci/blob/31dd0ffddf2a4a20106b4d65f7d4ce12d40d986d/NanoLoci_manual_30_04_24.pdf)) is under the development. More details on all steps of analysis and use cases are being added.

## Compatibility

nanoLoci has been tested on the following platform:
- Operating System: Windows 10
- MATLAB Version: 2022a

While nanoLoci may work on other configurations, we recommend using it on a system that matches the tested platform for optimal performance and compatibility.
